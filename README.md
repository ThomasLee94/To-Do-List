# To-Do-List

Description:

Creating a basic to-do-list web app that CRUD's. 

Motivation:

This to-do-list is a small feature that will be part of a 'greater' application that will house other productivity features. The tentative name of this application will be "Single Source". Some other useful features that Single Source will have is a calendar tab and perhaps a further note-taking tab. After that, I will work on allowing for communication between the tabs, for example if there is an event added to the calendar tab I want this event to be automatically saved in the to-do-list tab.

The to-do-list tab is nothing different to what is already out there, I have simply tried to make a simple to-do-list on a single page with no re-directions for ease of use. 


Design:

Bootstrap with some CSS. Although mostly in bootstrap, I have tried to make the main page responsive with flex-box. 


Features (In progress):
1. Basic login page to differentiate users.
2. Date and time tag for list creation.

Future features:
1. Automatic saving of lists (saves every keystroke).
2. Search bar for lists on-top of list-view tab.
